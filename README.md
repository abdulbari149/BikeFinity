# BikeFinity 
#### A Full Stack Mobile Application

## About

Our project is a customized bike platform for sports bikes but is not limited to sports bikes but different bikes as well. We all know how enthusiast bikers in Pakistan are but there is no platform for them. With the ease of our application, our bike riders can host biking events that include racing and night track rides as well. Also, a versatile option of reviews would be available to view or you could post one as well. Additionally, a separate section would be available for users where they could advertise their bikes or get one in their desired budget. Our resourceful platform is a one-stop shop for your biking endurance, whether you need to join a bike community, get yourself a perfect bike or check for bike reviews.
